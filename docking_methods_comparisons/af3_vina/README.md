# NAMD Simulations (AF3 + AF2/Vina)

This directory contains NAMD simulations of:
- AF3-inferred and docked complexes  
- SMBA docked comlpexes (AF2 + Vina)

These are the 20 complexes with the highest ligand binding-site RMSD (after protein alignment) selected from the AF3 docking results.  

## Notes on Parameters

- `silcs_bio/` contains the first iteration of the simulations (has incorrect atom ordering / parameter issues)  
- `charmm/` contains the corrected parameters and updated simulations
